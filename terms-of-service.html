            unless explicitly stated in writing on your invoice.</p>

        <h2>4. Warranty Terms (Critical - Please Read)</h2>
        <p><strong>⚠️ IMPORTANT WARRANTY DISCLOSURE:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Products sold by Binapani Automation are warranted BY US, not by the original manufacturer.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>New Products:</strong> 12-month seller warranty provided by Binapani Automation</li>

            <li><strong>Repaired Items:</strong> 3-month warranty on repairs performed</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Manufacturer warranty may NOT apply:</strong> If you attempt to claim warranty directly from the
            manufacturer (e.g., Siemens, ABB), they may reject it as we are not their authorized distributor. Your
            warranty coverage is through Binapani Automation only, as stated on your invoice.</p>
        <p>If manufacturer warranty is available, it will be <strong>explicitly stated in writing</strong> on your
            purchase invoice.</p>

            of our products or services. Our liability is limited to the purchase price of the product or service.</p>

        <p>Our legal right to resell branded products is established under the <strong>First Sale Doctrine</strong> and

            the right to resell it.</p>
        <p>The use of brand names on our website is for <strong>identification purposes only</strong> and constitutes
            nominative fair use under trademark law.</p>
